# Git Graphical Interfaces
_This module is a work in progress._

In addition to using the command line interface (cli), various products exist which offer a graphical user interface. 
This has the potential to ease your workflow by providing buttons, selection tools, separate windows, context menus, and 
better visuals. All the same commands are available via the cli, however, the gui applications makes them available 
for selection via the mouse instead of relying on help commands to know what is available. That being said, beware of 
the more advanced functionality of git. If there is an option that you don't recognize, don't select it until you know 
what you are doing. 

In this module, we will take a short tour of some popular tools and ones that are very relevant to Summit's workflow: 
- GitHub Desktop
- Visual Studio
- Visual Studio Code
- RStudio
- PyCharm (and other JetBrain IDEs)

# Welcome to `git-school`!

## Goal

The goal of `git-school` is to get you up and running with the following:

- a SSH key that you can use to authenticate into our GitLab server (rather than typing your username and password constantly)
- an account on our GitLab server
- a basic `git` workflow for coding collaboratively with other Summiteers

## Install `git`

To do any of this cool stuff, you need to install `git`:

- [ ] Download `git` here: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [ ] You can follow all of the defaults during installation

Check that you successfully installed `git` by:

- [ ] Opening the `Git Bash` application
- [ ] In the `Git Bash` terminal that opens, issue this command: `git --version`
- [ ] If you do not have `Git Bash` installed or you get an error from `git --version`, you have a problem.
